# IMPORTANT:  this sig-test.map file for use with JDK 8 only!
#             Using this file with other version of JDK will yield errors.
#
# The signature test mapping file for the JSON-P 2.0.0 TCK.  This file
# should be formatted as a standard java properties file.  The
# name is the package name and the value is the version of the
# package that should be tested by the signature tests.
#
# The resultant signature file name has a name that complies
# with the following format:
# <package>.sig_<technology_version>_<JavaSE_version_these_work_with>
# Given this format, the following example breaks down as follows:
#    jakarta.json.sig_2.0.0_se8:
#    jakarta.json.sig_2.0.0_se11:
#      <package> = jakarta.json
#      <technology_version> = 2.0.0  (for JSON-P) 
#      <JavaSE_version_these_work_with> = se8 and se11
#
# For this release valid versions are:  "_se8", "_se11", or "_se8_se11"
# This sig-test.map file is designed to be run using JDK 8 so any
# signature file that ends with "_se8"  or "se8_se11" will be valid.
# if a signature file contains only "_se8"  and no reference to "_se11" 
# in the signature name, than that means that signature file MUST only
# be referenced when using JDK 8.
