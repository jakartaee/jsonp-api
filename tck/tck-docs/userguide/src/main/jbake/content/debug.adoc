6 Debugging Test Problems
-------------------------

There are a number of reasons that tests can fail to execute properly.
This chapter provides some approaches for dealing with these failures.
Please note that most of these suggestions are only relevant when
running the test harness in GUI mode.

This chapter includes the following topics:

6.1 Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The goal of a test run is for all tests in the test suite that are not
filtered out to have passing results. If the root test suite folder
contains tests with errors or failing results, you must troubleshoot and
correct the cause to satisfactorily complete the test run.

* Errors: Tests with errors could not be executed by the Junit
framework. These errors usually occur because the test environment is not
properly configured.
* Failures: Tests that fail were executed but had failing results.


For every test run, the Junit framework creates a set of report files
in the target directory.


If a large number of tests failed, you should read
link:#GBFYF[Configuration Failures] to see if a
configuration issue is the cause of the failures.

6.2 Configuration Failures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configuration failures are easily recognized because many tests fail the
same way. When all your tests begin to fail, you may want to stop the
run immediately and start viewing individual test output.
