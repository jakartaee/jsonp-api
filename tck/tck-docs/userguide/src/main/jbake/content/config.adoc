4 Setup and Configuration
-------------------------


[NOTE]
====
The Jakarta EE Specification process provides for any number of compatible implementations.
As additional implementations become available, refer to project or product documentation from
those vendors for specific TCK setup and operational guidance.

====

This chapter describes how to set up the {TechnologyShortName} TCK . 
Before proceeding with the instructions in
this chapter, be sure to install all required software, as described in
link:install.html#GBFTP[Chapter 3, "Installation."]

After completing the instructions in this chapter, proceed to
link:using.html#GBFWO[Chapter 5, "Executing Tests,"] for instructions on
running the {TechnologyShortName} TCK.

[NOTE]
====
The {TechnologyShortName} TCK is not depended on any particular build 
tool to run the tests. It will be convenient and advisable to create a 
Apache Maven project to setup and run the TCK.
This chapter will henceforth use instructions and steps to provide setup 
with Apache Maven as a build tool.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
NOTE TO WRITERS:
The following sections should be customized for the technology.
This text was originally from the JAX-RS TCK.  Most references
to JAX-RS have been parameterized to serve as a simple starting
point for customization.  There are still many details that will
need to be changed or removed.  The major sections 4.1, 4.2, and
4.3 should be preserved.  If their titles are changed, the links
at the top of config.adoc will need to be changed as well as well
as toc.adoc.

4.1 Configuring Your Environment to Run the TCK Against the Compatible Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After configuring your environment as described in this section,
continue with the instructions in link:#GBFUY[Section 4.6, "Using the
JavaTest Harness Software."]


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

In these instructions, variables in angle brackets need to be expanded
for each platform. For example, `<JAVA_HOME>` becomes `$JAVA_HOME` on
Solaris/Linux and `%JAVA_HOME%` on Windows. In addition, the forward
slashes (`/`) used in all of the examples need to be replaced with
backslashes (`\`) for Windows. Finally, be sure to use the appropriate
separator for your operating system when specifying multiple path
entries (`;` on Windows, `:` on UNIX/Linux).

On Windows, you must escape any backslashes with an extra backslash in
path separators used in any of the following properties, or use forward
slashes as a path separator instead.

=======================================================================


1.  Set the following environment variables in your shell environment:
  a.  `JAVA_HOME` to the directory in which Java SE {SEversion} is installed
  b.  `M2_HOME` to the directory in which the Apache Maven build tool is installed.
  c.  +{TechnologyHomeEnv}+ to the directory in which the {TechnologyShortName}
  {TechnologyVersion} CI has been installed
  d.  `PATH` to include the following directories: `JAVA_HOME/bin`,
  and `M2_HOME/bin`
2.  Set the following System properties:
  a. `jakarta.json.provider` property is set to run the {TechnologyShortName} TCK
  pluggability tests to test the SPI provider interface.
  This property should only be set when running the pluggability tests. All other tests use the
  provider supplied with the {TechnologyShortName} {TechnologyVersion} implementation under test.
  b. `jimage.dir` property is set to extract the Java SE {SEversion} modules for running the signature tests.

3. Set the below jars to the classpath 
  a. JAR file for the {TechnologyShortName} {TechnologyVersion} API. +
  `jakarta.json-api.jar`.
  c. JUnit 5 jars ({JunitVersion})
  Maven cordinates :

          <type>pom</type>
          <scope>import</scope>
       </dependency>
----

 d. sigtest-maven-plugin (1.4) to run the signature tests.
